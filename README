ActsAsRated
===========

This is a simple plugin to do a simple rating/ranking system over a collection of objects.

Two integer columns are used: raw_rating and ranking.

raw_rating is the raw calculated value of the rules specified in the acts_as_rated block.

ranking is the normalized value.  A raw rating of 0 is always rank 0, otherwise the raw ratings
are scaled to a range of 1-100.

Two instance methods are added:

explain_rating and calculate_rating.

One class method is added:

update_ranking to update the ranking value.

Example
=======

	class TestRated < ActiveRecord::Base
	  acts_as_rated do
	    desc "Add 10 points if OK"
	    add 10, :if => :ok
    
	    desc "Add -10 points unless not ok"
	    add -10, :unless => :not_ok
    
	    desc "Add age"
	    add do
	      52 * age
	    end
    
	    desc "+1 each attendee"
	    add 1, :count => :num_attendees
	  end
	end
